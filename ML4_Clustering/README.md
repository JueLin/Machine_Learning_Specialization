## Description:

This is the final course in the Machine Learning Specialization, organized by University of Washington. This repository contains my personal solution to weekly assignments in this course for sharing purpose. If you like this course, I highly recommend you go through the enitre specialization on Coursera. But the cancellation of course 5 and 6 is somewhat disappointing though. Anyway, big thanks to Prof. Carlos Guestrin and Prof. Emily Fox from U of Washington, for the effort of designing this awesome and comprehensive specialization.
